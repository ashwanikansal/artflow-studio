I usually draw stylized anime portraits and emotional characters.
I like monochrome sketches, detailed eyes, and expressive faces.
Tools: Procreate on tablet using stylus.
Audience: People who like anime, moody aesthetics, and character design.
I prefer darker moods, emotional expressions, and close-up portraits.

Goals:
- Grow Instagram engagement slowly but consistently.
- Focus on quality art, not spam.
- Build a small community of art lovers and other artists.
