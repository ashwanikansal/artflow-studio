Phase 1:

1. Created a local chroma Db, Knowledge base from local data (posts.json & style_notes.md)
2. Created a RAG on this Knowledge base.
3. Ideation Module: Generate art ideas based on local Knowledge base.
    Challenges:
        a. How to get proper json format output? According to our ArtIdeaSet?
        b. After getting json, how to make sure, LLM always return complete ideas? and not truncate them inbetween?

4. Generate Captions, hastags, reel making tips for the selected idea. Same challenges as in step 3.
5. Adding Engagement Assitant - generate thoughtful reply for comments (local json)
6. Adding a sqlite db to log all the generated ideas, generated captions with hastags, generated replies for comments.
    Adding functionality to access recent ideas, recent comment replies, and any idea captions and hastags. 
7. Adding a streamlit UI for these features.

Phase 2:

1. Now we will will add a trend miner here, which checks the song or visual trends currently going on. For now they will pick trends from local storage.
    Earlier our RAG based drawing idea generator, used only our RAG context.
    But now it will use RAG context + trends. So adding trends logic to ideation_module.
